# Q_Learning_Pong
Pong implemented by Q-Learning

2 pickle files are models already trained with 100K games, with current parameter. average
rebound 9 times.

Use game.py for all testing.(Because itâ€™s fast). Set up as training
from empty model. Can uncomment lines to load in the trained pickle
files.

game_vis.py is only for extra credit, so just use it to load the
trained models(pickle files) and then screen capture(gif) to show the
agent is working !
